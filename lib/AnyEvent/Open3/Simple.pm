# ABSTRACT: interface to open3 under AnyEvent
# VERSION

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use v5.10;
 use AnyEvent;
 use AnyEvent::Open3::Simple;
 
 my $done = AnyEvent->condvar;
 
 my $ipc = AnyEvent::Open3::Simple(
   on_stdout => sub { say 'out: ', pop },
   on_stderr => sub { say 'err: ', pop },
   on_exit   => sub {
     my($proc, $exit_value, $signal) = @_;
     say 'exit value: ', $exit_value;
     say 'signal:     ', $signal;
     $done->send;
   },
 );

 $done->recv;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides an interface to open3 while running under AnyEvent
that delivers data from stdout and stderr as lines are written by the
subprocess.  The interface is reminiscent of L<IPC::Open3::Simple>, 
although this module does provides a somewhat different API, so it
cannot be used a drop in replacement for that module.

There are already a number of interfaces for interacting with subprocesses
in the context of L<AnyEvent>, but this one is the most convenient for my
usage.  Note the modules listed in the SEE ALSO section below for other 
interfaces that may be more or less appropriate.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

Constructor takes a hash or hashref of event callbacks.  These events
will be triggered by the subprocess when the run method is called.
Each even callback (except on_error) gets passed in an instance of 
L<AnyEvent::Open3::Simple::Process> as its first argument which can be
used to get the PID of the subprocess, or to write to it.  on_error
does not get a process object because it indicates an error in the 
creation of the process.

=head2 EVENTS

Not all of these events will fire depending on the execution of the 
child process.

=over 4

=item * on_start ($proc)

Called after the process is created, but before the run method returns
(that is, it does not wait to re-enter the event loop first).

=item * on_stdout ($proc, $line)

Called on every line printed to stdout by the child process.

=item * on_stderr ($proc, $line)

Called on every line printed to stderr by the child process.

=item * on_exit ($proc, $exit_value, $signal)

Called when the processes completes, either because it called exit,
or if it was killed by a signal.  

=item * on_signal ($proc, $signal)

Called when the processes is terminated by a signal.

=item * on_fail ($proc, $exit_value)

Called when the process returns a non-zero exit value.

=item * on_error ($error)

Called when there is an execution error, for example, if you ask
to run a program that does not exist.  No process is passed in
because the process failed to create.  The error passed in is 
the error thrown by L<IPC::Open3> (typically a string which begins
with "open3: ...").

In some environments open3 is unable to detect exec errors in the
child.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 $ipc-E<gt>run($program, @arguments)

Start the given program with the given arguments.  Returns
immediately.  Any events that have been specified in the
constructor (except for on_start) will not be called until
the process re-enters the event loop.

=head1 CAVEATS

Some AnyEvent implementations may not work properly with the method
used by AnyEvent::Open3::Simple to wait for the child process to 
terminate.  See L<AnyEvent/"CHILD-PROCESS-WATCHERS"> for details.

This module is not supported under Windows (MSWin32), but it does seem
to work under Cygwin (cygwin).  Patches are welcome for any platforms
that don't work.

There are some traps for the unwary relating to buffers and deadlocks,
L<IPC::Open3> is recommended reading.
